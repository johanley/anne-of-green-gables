<h2>The <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> + <em>Git</em> Project</h2>
 
<ul> 
 <li>Goal: <b>proof-read and compare</b> editions of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>, by L. M. Montgomery
 <li>Project Status: just starting
</ul>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<ul> 
 <li>it's a good novel, worthy of detailed examination
 <li>at least some of the widely available digitized texts don't seem to be of high quality
 <li>it's interesting to see how the various editions differ from each other
 <li>it's interesting to use the power of <em>git</em> to precisely track the variations of a literary text
 <li>a text of acceptable quality can be used to print your own copy using <a href='https://www.lulu.com/'>lulu.com</a>
 <li>it may help improve the quality of digitized versions of the novel
</ul>


<h3>Bibliography</h3>

The following is based on the <a href='https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393926958'><em>Norton</em> critical edition</a>, by Rubio and Waterston, 
which has an excellent summary of the main editions.

<P>Interesting remarks from the critical edition of Rubio and Waterston:
<ul>
 <li>regarding Page's 40th impression, published in 1916: <em>"no other copy-text can claim to represent her final intentions as much as this 1908 edition."</em>
 <li><em>"Montgomery gave no personal input into either of these completely new 1925 editions."</em>
 <li>regarding the two new 1925 editions: <em>"However, a careful comparison of the newly set Harrap and L. C. Page texts (which are very different in themselves)
 reveals a common line of descent—not from the manuscript but from the lost typescript."</em>
</ul>

<h3>Scanned Books</h3>
Some editions have been imaged and made available on the web.

<P>
There are <a href='https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-books-montgomery-anne-of-green-gables-online-1.5673603'>plans</a> to make images of the manuscript available in 2022.
Montgomery's handwriting is hard to read. Most would prefer the <a href='https://nimbus.ca/store/anne-of-green-gables-the-original-manuscript.html'>transcription</a> edited by C. S. Collins.

<h3>Sources of Digitized Text</h3>

<ul>
 <li><a href='https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20080509'>Faded Page</a> - current version as of 2008-05-09. (Companion site to <a href='https://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/default.php'>Distributed Proofreaders Canada</a>.)
 <li><a href='https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Anne_of_Green_Gables_(1908)'>Wikisource</a>
 <li><a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45'>Project Gutenberg</a> - current version as of 2016-10-06. They usually get texts from Distributed Proofreaders, but not always.
</ul>

Issues:
<ul>
 <li>sometimes they aren't explicit about the copy-text used as source.
 <li>basic facts are often unclear, or hard to find: How many versions have there been? What were the changes between versions? How 
 many people have edited the text?
 <li>in short, there's no way to evaluate the quality of the text.
</ul>


<h3>UTF-8 Encoding Everywhere</h3>
All text files in this project use the <a href='http://utf8everywhere.org/'>UTF-8 encoding</a>. 
If you see odd characters on your screen, check that your tools are using the UTF-8 encoding.


<h3>Character Issues</h3>

<P>You can investigate specific characters <a href='https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Unicode/whatisit.html'>here</a>. 

 
<h3>Standardized Line Breaks</h3>

The <em>git</em> tool compares files line by line, and character by character.
It has no knowledge of what a sentence is. 

<P>It can easily compare text that has the same line breaks, say

<P style="white-space: pre;">
<em>I don't deny there's something in what you say, Rachel.
I've had some qualms myself.</em>
</P>

<P>versus the slightly different text:

<div style="white-space: pre;">
<em>I do not deny there's something in what you say, Rachel.
I've had some qualms myself.</em>
</div>


<P>But it <b>can't effectively compare text that has different line breaks</b>:

<P><div style="white-space: pre;">
<em>I don't deny there's something in 
what you say, Rachel. I've had some qualms myself.</em>
</div>

<P>versus:

<div style="white-space: pre;">
<em>I do not deny there's something in what you say, Rachel.
I've had some qualms myself.</em>
</div>

<P>With such text, <em>git</em> will find a huge number of trivial differences just because of the line breaks.

<P>With two independent sources of a text, it's extremely likely that the line-breaks will different.
The work-around is to enforce a policy: <b>each line is a complete sentence</b>. 
 
<h3>Text Editor Recommendations</h3>
In this project, it's recommended that your text editor software:
<ul>
 <li>should have menu actions for saving changes to the <em>git</em> repository (it should know about <em>git</em>)
 <li>must use UTF-8 encoding (check the settings)
 <li>must not have an auto-correction tool 
 <li>can apply line-wrap to text, according to the width of the current window, without saving new line breaks to the underlying file
 <li>should be able to indicate invisible characters (spaces and line breaks)
</ul>

Here's a <a href='images/eclipse.jpg'>screen shot</a> of the <a href='https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/'>Eclipse</a> code editor being used to proofread text versus a scanned 
version of the book on archive.org. 
Note how it is wrapping the long sentences in the window, and showing special symbols for spaces and line breaks.

<h3>Two <em>github</em> Repositories</h3>
This project has two github repositories, not one:
<ul>
 <li><em><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables'>anne-of-green-gables</a></em>: a repo for documentation (what you're reading now), with one branch only.
 <li><em><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions'>anne-of-green-gables-editions</a></em>: a repo for the various editions of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>, with one branch for each edition.
</ul>

Branching can only be done at the top level, the level of the repository. 
It's best to use a structure that reflects the underlying data.


<h3>Uncorrected Versus Corrected</h3>
Almost every text has items that could be corrected in some way. 
<b>In this project, corrections to the text are handled by branches</b>:
<ul>
 <li>the core branch for an edition will have <b>zero</b> corrections applied to it.
 <li>secondary branches, branched off of the core, are used to apply corrections to the core text.
</ul>

Some corrections are for egregious and obvious typos, but others are more subtle.
The policy of what to apply as a correction, and what not to apply, is a decision that can be made in many different ways.
That policy is thus best relegated to a secondary branch, and not to the core data.
The core data remains the core data, without ambiguity, while different policies for applying corrections can be applied at will in a secondary branch off of the core.

<h3>No Front Matter</h3>
This project captures the contents of the 38 chapters of the book.
Items outside the chapters, including the table of contents, aren't captured here.

<h3>Chapter Title Conventions</h3>
The chapter titles are to be placed on the first line of each chapter. 
The chapter title appears in the file names, but that is for convenience only.
The <em>official</em> chapter title is the first line of the text file.
For example, if you wish to put a comma in the title of <em>Diana is Invited to Tea With Tragic Results</em>, then just alter the first line of the 
file for that chapter; do <em>not</em> change the name of the file.
