<h2>The <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> + <em>Git</em> Project</h2>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<ul> 
 <li>to <b>significantly improve</b> the quality of (open-source) transcriptions of the novel
 <li>to <b>detect transcription errors</b> by doing <em><a href='images/diff.png'>diffs</a></em> between different transcriptions
 <li>to document errors and issues in the first editions
 <li>to document the variations between editions
 <li>to <a href='https://www.lulu.com/'>print</a> a copy of the novel, using a robust text
</ul>

<P>You can also use the text to create your own e-book, in epub or mobi format.

<P><span class='err'>Doing <em><a href='images/diff.png'>diffs</a></em> with other transcriptions lets a proof-reader <b>stand on the shoulders of others</b></span>.
That is the main point of this project.

<h3 id='main-results'>Main Results So Far</h3>
<em>Result #1</em>: a <a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions/tree/1908-LCP-4th'>robust transcription</a>
of the <em>uncorrected</em> text of an early edition: 1908 L. C. Page (4th impression).
This edition was chosen simply because it is the earliest available on archive.org.
It was produced by proof-reading versus this <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n9/mode/2up'>copy-text on archive.org</a>, by one person (John O'Hanley) over a 24 day period, 
and then (this is the important point) it was <a href='#simple-scheme-for-error-detection'><em>diffed</em></a> with three other independent transcriptions 
to eliminate many transcription errors.

<P><em>Result #2</em>: a list of <a href='#known-issues-1908-4th-impression'>errors/issues with the 1908-LCP-4th text</a>, gathered 
from critical editions and my own proof-reading. 

<P><em>Result #3</em>: the above list of errors has been applied to the uncorrected text, and is available <a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions/tree/1908-LCP-4th-corrected'>here</a> as a separate transcription.
<span class='err'><b>For most people, this is the most useful item in this project.</b></span>
A raw listing of the actual differences between the <em>uncorrected</em> and <em>corrected</em> versions can be viewed <a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables/blob/master/docs/diffs/2021-01-07/1908-LCP-4th-versus-1908-LCP-4th-corrected.txt'>here</a>.

<P><em>Result #4</em>: I have detected issues in other transcriptions:
<ul>
 <li>Distributed Proofreaders of Canada - <a href='#issues-dpc'>33 issues</a>, <b>30 of which have been corrected</b> as of 2021-01-09.
 The corrections were applied by Ross Cooling of fadedpage.com. 
 <li>Wikisource - <a href='#issues-wikisource'>113 issues</a>, <b>111 of which have been corrected</b> as of 2021-01-07.
 The corrections were applied by this project, James Tauber (working independently on  <a href='https://github.com/jtauber/anne-of-green-gables'>his own project</a>), and several Wikisource editors who graciously tracked down a few minor bugs over the course of several days.
</ul>

<P><em>Result #5</em>: My transcription was accepted by Project Gutenberg, and <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64365'>published to their site on 2021-01-21</a>.
My transcription is now their second transcription (in English) of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>.
The first one has about 1,000 differences with the first edition of the novel.
Many of those differences are caused by modernization and Americanization. 
The remaining differences are still numerous, and show significant, non-trivial changes to the text.
My transcription, on the other hand, is <em>much</em> closer to the text of the first edition.


<h3 id='why-use-git'>Why use <em><a href='https://git-scm.com/'>git</a></em>?</h3>
<ul> 
 <li>it can reflect different transcriptions/editions naturally using different <em>branches</em>
 <li>it lets you clearly see the variants (the <em><a href='images/diff.png'>diff</a></em>) between editions
 <li>it lets you post improvements after each proof-reading cycle
 <li>it's a widely used, robust tool, well-suited to the job
</ul>

<h3 id='two-github-repositories'>Two <em>github</em> Repositories</h3>
This project has two github repositories, not one:
<ul>
 <li><em><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables'>anne-of-green-gables</a></em>: a repo for documentation (which you're reading now), with one branch only.
 <li><em><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions'>anne-of-green-gables-editions</a></em>: a repo for various transcriptions of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>, with one branch for each transcription.
 Branches can also be created for applying corrections/edits to a transcription.
 Merging between branches is <em>not</em> a typical operation in this project. 
 The main requirement is simply to do <em>diffs</em> between branches.
</ul>


<h3 id='list-current-branches'>List of Current Branches</h3>

The <a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions/tree/master'>master</a> branch has only empty stub files for each chapter.

<P>The main outputs of this project are on these branches:
<ul>
 <li><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions/tree/1908-LCP-4th'>1908-LCP-4th</a> - with no corrections applied to any errors (warts and all). 
 The copy-text is the L. C. Page, 1st edition, 4th impression.
 <li><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions/tree/1908-LCP-4th-corrected'>1908-LCP-4th-corrected</a> - these <a href='#known-issues-certain-or-likely'>errors</a> in the text have been corrected. 
 <span class='err'><b>This is the branch that most people should use.</b></span>
 <li><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions/tree/1908-LCP-4th-pg'>1908-LCP-4th-pg</a> - intended for input to Project Gutenberg.
 Only the most serious errors are corrected.
</ul>
 
Transcriptions by other parties, used for <em>diffing</em> with respect to this project's transcription:
<ul>
 <li><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions/tree/DIG-DPC-2008-05'>DIG-DPC-2008-05</a> - a copy of the transcription from Distributed Proofreaders of Canada. The copy-text is 1946 Ryerson Press.
 <li><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions/tree/DIG-DPC-2008-05-B'>DIG-DPC-2008-05-B</a> - Second cycle of error detection/correction, after initial corrections applied.
 <li><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions/tree/DIG-WIK-1908-11th'>DIG-WIK-1908-11th</a> - a copy of the transcription from Wikisource. The copy-text is 1908 L. C. Page, 11th impression.
 <li><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions/tree/DIG-WIK-1908-11th-B'>DIG-WIK-1908-11th-B</a> - Second cycle of error detection/correction, after initial corrections applied.
 <li><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions/tree/DIG-GUT-0000'>DIG-GUT-0000</a> - a copy of the 2016 transcription from Project Gutenberg. The copy-text is not stated. It seems to be a mix of different sources.
</ul>





<h3 id='lingo'>Lingo</h3>

<ul>
 <li><b>copy-text</b> - the exact book which is being transcribed (identified by publisher, year, impression, and so on).
 <li><b>transcription</b> - the content of the <em>copy-text</em>, in a text file. The text file is usually proof-read by one or more humans.
 <li><b>transcription error</b> - a mismatch between the <em>copy-text</em> and its <em>transcription</em>. 
 <li><b>branch</b> - in a version control system (such as <em><a href='https://git-scm.com/'>git</a></em>), a <em>branch</em> is a separate, parallel stream, containing a 
 sequence of revisions of files.
 In this project, different <em>copy-texts</em> get different <em>branches</em> for their <em>transcriptions</em>.
 Each <em>branch</em> can have multiple revisions of its <em>transcription</em>.
 <li><b>diff</b> - the result of comparing two revisions of a file (often across different <em>branches</em>). Shows the textual 
 variations, the places where the two revisions differ in any way. Here's an <a href='images/diff.png'>example</a> of 
 a tool showing a diff.
</ul>

<h3 id='simple-scheme-for-error-detection'>Simple Scheme for Error Detection</h3>

<P>From what I can see, the groups on the web that provide transcriptions don't talk to each other. 
They don't compare their transcriptions to the output of other similar groups. 

<P>The idea of this project is simply that <span class='err'><b>doing diffs on independent transcriptions is an easy way to 
find a large number of errors, and significantly increase accuracy.</b></span>

<P>Some <em>ad hoc</em> lingo, for the nonce:
<ul>
 <li><b>TE(A)</b> - the transcription errors in a single transcription A. 
 <li><b>UTE(A, B, C)</b> - the <em>universal</em> transcription errors <em>common</em> to a <em>set</em> of transcriptions A, B, C.   
 That is, the transcription errors <b>repeated in exactly the same way</b> across all members of a set of transcriptions A, B, and C.
</ul>

<h4>Work Flow For Improving My Transcription</h4>

<img src='images/work-flow-diagram.png' title='Work flow'>
<P>First I do a full proof-read of my transcription.

<img src='images/boxes.png' title='diff eliminates most errors' style='float: right; margin:1.0em;'  height='550' width='220' >

<P>Then, for each of the other transcriptions A, B, C:
<ul>
 <li>I do a diff between <em>me</em> and the other transcription
 <li>for each difference, I find out if it's a real textual difference in the copy-text, or a transcription error. 
 I do this by visually comparing directly with the copy-text itself (for example on archive.org).
 <li>if it's a transcription error, then I fix one of the transcriptions (in rare cases, both). 
 In this case, I'm removing one item from TE(me) or TE(A).
 Note that only the <em>non-universal</em> transcription errors are found using this technique.
</ul> 

At the end of the process, what's left over is UTE(A, B, C, me), the universal transcription errors, the ones that are <b>exactly the same in <em>all</em> of the transcriptions</b>.


<P>The UTE(A, B, C, me) errors are more difficult to deal with.
They can't be found by doing diffs, since they are present in all of the input transcriptions.
Can they be detected using other means?
In a few isolated cases, yes. 
If a policy of Americanization or modernization has been applied to all transcriptions, then that policy can be 
reversed, in whole or in part, by writing a simple find-replace script to change the transcription.
But those are special cases (marked as 'known', in the above diagram).


<h4>Rule 1: All non-universal errors can be eliminated by doing diffs.</h4>

<b>TE(me) ⇒ UTE(A, B, C, me)</b>

<P>At the end of the process described above, the transcription errors in my output equal the <em>universal</em> transcription errors
across all of the inputs. This expresses the benefit of doing diffs. 

<h4>Rule 2: Independent transcriptions having no common ancestor are best.</h4>
It's best that each transcription be as <em>independent</em> from the others as possible:
<ul>
 <li>different copy-text
 <li>different OCR (optical character recognition) machine/software
 <li>different proof-readers 
 <li>different organizations
</ul> 

Such independence pushes the system in the direction of avoiding universal transcription errors.

<P>Somewhat surprisingly, it's beneficial to even use different editions of the source text.
For example, this project uses a transcription of a 1946 edition of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> to 
produce a transcription of the 1908 edition (4th impression).
This is beneficial because it <em>ensures more independence</em> of transcriptions. 
It's not a problem, because the real textual diffs between 1908 and 1946 are small, and are detected and accounted for by the 
work flow described above.

<h4>Rule 3: In the end, for a large text, you'll never be sure that you have reduced TE(me) to zero.</h4>
A computer can compute an exact result only when all of the data is present. 
But in this case, one half of the data is in a physical book, outside the computer. That's the problem.
Still, you can increase your level of confidence in a transcription by using the above technique.



<h3 id='early-editions-and-critical-editions'>Early Editions and Later Critical Editions</h3>

The following is based on the <a href='https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393926958'><em>Norton</em> critical edition</a>, by Rubio and Waterston, 
which has an excellent summary of the main editions.

<P>Interesting remarks from the critical edition of Rubio and Waterston:
<ul>
 <li>regarding Page's 40th impression, published in 1916: <em>"no other copy-text can claim to represent her final intentions as much as this 1908 edition."</em>
 <li><em>"Montgomery gave no personal input into either of these completely new 1925 editions."</em>
 <li>regarding the two new 1925 editions: <em>"However, a careful comparison of the newly set Harrap and L. C. Page texts (which are very different in themselves)
 reveals a common line of descent—not from the manuscript but from the lost typescript."</em>

 Companion site to <a href='https://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/default.php'>Distributed Proofreaders Canada</a>. 
 Their copy-text is the 1946-11 Ryerson edition (see link above). 
 With the many corrections recently applied, this transcription is now fairly close to my transcription.
 Some remaining differences are simply differences in the underlying copy-text.
 <li><a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45'>Project Gutenberg</a> (2016 version) - 
 They usually get texts from Distributed Proofreaders, but not in this case.
 They don't even indicate the copy-text. 
 See below for clues that indicate the copy-text is derived from multiple sources.
 This transcription has many differences with 1908-LCP.
 <li><a href='https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Anne_of_Green_Gables_(1908)'>Wikisource</a> - Their copy-text is 1908-LCP, 11th impression. 
 With the many corrections recently applied, this transcription is now very close to my transcription (for 1908-LCP, 4th impression).
 <li><a href='https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/l-m-montgomery/anne-of-green-gables'>Standard Ebooks</a> - apparently uses Project Gutenberg as source of their text. (I don't know if they have proof-read/edited the text themselves. I suspect not.)
 I haven't used their transcription in this project, but it's useful to mention them as a possible source people might use.
</ul>

A common issue: there seems to be no easy way to evaluate the probable quality of a transcription.

<h3 id='distance-between-transcriptions'>Distance Between Transcriptions</h3>
Two transcriptions can differ from each other for various reasons:
<ul>
 <li>transcription errors
 <li>real differences in the underlying copy-text
 <li>corrections to real errors in the underlying copy-text
 <li>minor differences that don't change the meaning of the text

<P>It would be very unusual if two transcriptions of a long novel were absolutely identical.

<P>Various stats can be used to <b>quantify how different two transcriptions are</b>.
For example, here are some stats output by git's <a href='https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff'><em>diff</em></a> command.
They show the distance between the <em>1908-LCP-4th</em> branch and this project's <b>initial snapshots</b> of other transcriptions.
The smaller the number, the more similar they are.

<P>Of the three transcriptions that come from other parties, 
the Project Gutenberg 2016 transcription is the only one that has modernized and Americanized the spelling.
That contributes to the larger number for that transcription.

<P>The 1946-RP text uses the 1925-LCP plates, so the underlying copy-text is more distant from 1908.
At the same time, this project found fewer transcription errors for DPC than for Wikisource.

<P>Links to the detailed diffs require a lot of horizontal scrolling.
It's recommended to download the file from github.

<P>You can see that my transcription is now quite close to those of Wikisource and Distributed Proofreaders Canada.
The DPC transcription is further away than Wikisource because its underlying copy-text is further away.


<h3 id='policy-for-typos-errors'>Policy For Typos/Errors</h3>
Almost every copy-text has items that could be corrected in some way (typos and so on). 
<b>In this project, absolutely all such corrections are handled by using multiple <em>branches</em> in <em>git</em></b>:
<ul>
 <li><b>the core branch for an edition will have zero corrections for typos</b> applied to it.
 <li>secondary branches, branched off of the core, are used to apply all corrections to the copy-text, 
 including basic corrections for egregious typos.
</ul>

Some corrections are for egregious and obvious typos, but other corrections are more subtle.
(An example of a subtle correction is to change the spelling of <em>Macpherson</em> to <em>MacPherson</em>.)
<b>The policy of what to apply as a correction, and what not to apply, is a decision that can be made in many different ways.</b>
That policy is best relegated to a secondary branch, and not to the core data.
The core data remains the core data, without ambiguity, exactly matching the copy-text (we hope), while different policies for applying corrections can be applied at will in a secondary branch off of the core.

<h3 id='no-front-matter'>No Front Matter</h3>
The transcription produced by this project captures the contents of the 38 chapters of the book.
Items outside the chapters, including the table of contents and dedication, aren't captured here.
(That being said, errors in the table of contents of 1908-LCP are noted below.)

<h3 id='chapter-title-conventions'>Chapter Title Conventions</h3>
The chapter titles are to be placed on the first line of each chapter. 
The chapter title appears in the file names, but that is for convenience only.
The <em>official</em> chapter title is the first line of the text file.
For example, if you wish to put a comma in the title of <em>Diana is Invited to Tea with Tragic Results</em>, then just alter the first line of the 
file for that chapter. <b>Don't change the name of the file</b>. That would mess things up.

 
<h3 id='proof-reading-of-1908-lcp'>Proof-reading of 1908-LCP</h3>
This project has proof-read the <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n9/mode/2up'>L. C. Page 1908 4th impression</a>, 
using scans on archive.org.
The proof-reading was done <a href='images/eclipse.jpg'>on screen</a> (not on paper, unfortunately), using the Eclipse code editor. 

In addition to proof-reading the text, the project has used <a href='images/diff.png'><em>diffs</em></a> (in the Eclipse code editor) with respect to other transcriptions, using the technique described above.
The other transcriptions used are:
<ul>
 <li>Distributed Proofreaders of Canada (<a href='https://archive.org/details/anneofgreengable00montiala/page/n7/mode/2up'>1946-RP</a>)
 <li>Wikisource (<a href='https://archive.org/details/anneofgreengable00mont_11/page/n7/mode/2up'>1908-LCP, 11th impression</a>)
 <li>Project Gutenberg (2016 version; copy-text not stated; possibly derived from various sources)
</ul>

After proof-reading each chapter, a number of proof-reading errors were corrected by doing <em>diffs</em> with these other transcriptions.
Here are the number of such corrections for each chapter:

<h2 id='known-issues-1908-4th-impression'>Known Issues: 1908, 4th impression</h2>
There are different types of issues encountered in this text.
A small number are serious, some are <em>mejum</em>, but most are <em>weeny-teeny</em>.
They are collected here to aid those who wish to edit the text, and produce their own version.
For more information, see the modern critical editions listed above.

<P>I have divided these issues into two kinds:
<ul>
 <li>errors: the text is either certainly or very likely in error in some way. 
  The idea is to stop the errors from propagating.
 <li>matters of taste: in my own opinion, changes that I would consider. 
</ul>
<b>Any such division is arbitrary, and opinions will assuredly differ.</b>
Nevertheless, I think it's helpful to others to make this kind of separation.


<h3 id='known-issues-certain-or-likely'>Issues: Errors (certain or likely): 22</h3>
Some issues are repeated, for a total of 27 actual occurrences in the text.

  <em>[Ch. 01, p2-3].</em>
  The right-quote is missing. The text is split across two pages in this case. 
  2007-NCE says this was corrected between the 5th impression and the 12th impression.
  The <a href='https://archive.org/details/anneofgreengable00mont_11/page/3/mode/2up?q=husband'>11th impression</a> shows a <em>change</em>, but it's still in error, since there are two opening quotes.

  <em>[Ch. 01, p8].</em>
  Misspelled. Should be '<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_John_Barnardo'>Barnardo</a>', as in MS. 
  According to 2007-NCE: only 1924-Cornstalk has 'Barnardo'; both 1925-LCP and 1927-GGH use 'Home boy' instead.
<P id='iss-08P-04'>

  <em>[Ch. 02 , p19].</em>
  Misspelled. Should be 'Hopetown'. Occurs in 3 places in the novel: Hopetown, Hopeton, Hopeton. MS always has Hopetown.
  The second occurrence:
  <ul>
   <li><em>[Ch. 05 , p57]:</em> 
     <span class='text'>the asylum at <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n74/mode/1up?q=Hopeton'><span class='err'>Hopeton</span></a></span><br>

  <em>[Ch. 07, p71]</em>
  The comma after <em>unchangeable</em> should really be after <em>eternal</em>.
  That will match the punctuation of the original text.
  <em>The Annotated Anne of Green Gables</em> points to this <a href='https://archive.org/details/expositioninform00harp/page/32/mode/2up'>misquoted catechism</a> as the source of the quote (page 32).

  <em>[Ch. 08, p84]</em>
   The period is missing after 'there'. Seems to be a defect in the printing, not in the image.
   The period is <a href='https://archive.org/details/anneofgreengable00mont_11/page/84/mode/1up?q=echo'>present but weak</a> in the 11th impression, and

  <em>[Ch. 16, p170]</em>
  Change to 'along with it'. Match the MS. Seems to be a clear grammatical error. <em>Annotated</em> makes this correction.
<P  id='iss-08P-11'>

  <em>[Ch. 16, p180]</em>
  Change 'its' to 'it'. 
  MS has 'its' as well. 
  Seems like an error in grammar. 
  There's nothing possessive here. 
  The text is in the narrator's voice, and doesn't seem to be colloquial. 
  In chapter 14 there's <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n156/mode/1up?q=about+its'>a second occurrence</a> of <em>about its</em>, but in Anne's voice, not the narrator's voice.

  Missing end quote.

  <em>[Ch. 19, p223]</em>
  Change to 'a while'.
  The noun phrase 'a while' has two words. The adverb form 'awhile' is a single word. 
  Chapter 16 uses 'awhile' correctly. 
  This issue isn't noted in any critical edition that I've seen.
  But it <em>is</em> corrected in the Penguin/Puffin edition of 2008 (which may in turn be derived from some earlier edition.)
  Other occurrences that should be changed to <em>a while</em> (two words):
  <ul>
   <li><em>[Ch. 25, p284]</em>: <span class='text'>sat for <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n309/mode/1up?q=awhile'><span class='err'>awhile</span></a></span><br>

  <em>[Ch. 20, p231]</em>

<P>* I haven't seen this issue mentioned elsewhere.


<h3 id='known-issues-non-issues'>Issues: not actually errors?</h3>
<P  id='iss-08P-23'>
  <span class='text'>Our spirits can <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n213/mode/2up'><span class='err'>comune.</span></a></span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 17, p190]</em>
  The correct spelling is <em>commune</em>, but this <b>probably shouldn't be corrected</b>, since Anne misspells several words in her letter: <em>comune, busum, improoving</em>.
  <em>Annotated</em> silently changes the spelling to <em>commune</em>, but leaves the spelling of the other two words.
  In this respect, they are matching the MS.
  It seems that 1925-GGH changes to 'commune' (example from <a href='https://archive.org/details/anneofgreengable00mont_12/page/156/mode/2up'>1930</a>).
  It seems that 1925-LCP also changes to 'commune' (example from <a href='https://archive.org/details/anne-of-green-gables_20201025/page/140/mode/2up'>1933</a>.)
  I disagree with these later editions. 
  I think the intent of the author was to intentionally misspell three words in the letter, not two, and that the spelling of the 
  first edition should be preserved.

  <span class='text'><a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n335/mode/2up'><span class='err'>pail</span></a> the barge</span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 28, p310]</em>
  Change to 'pall'. Match the MS. 
  2007-NCE says that this error in the first impression was actually corrected in the 4th impression, so it's not visible in the above link.
  But wait! This <a href='https://kindredspaces.ca/islandora/object/lmmi%3A1373?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=bea8968543c1027b364e&solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=2#page/337/mode/1up/search/pall'>1st impression</a>
  <b>does not have the error.</b> What's going on?
  
  <P>Coincidentally, I found a similar error when reading the novel <em>Germinie Lacerteux</em>.
  It has <a href='images/elle.png'>this mistake</a>, where the French word <em>elle</em> is poorly printed, and appears as <em>eile</em> instead.
  Such a misprint would change <em>pall</em> to <em>pail</em>.


<h3 id='issues-personal-taste'>Issues: personal taste</h3>
In the list below, I list some issues that I personally would like to examine when creating my own version of the text.
<b>They are a matter of opinion.
Don't take them too seriously.</b>
I'm just noting them here for my own benefit. 
You can take them as an example of the kind of edits someone might make to the core text, according to their taste.
These <em>speed bumps</em> are places in the text where, while reading, my attention is distracted from the make-believe world of the story to 
the real world of thinking about the text's style.

<P>
  <span class='text'>And as for the <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n25/mode/2up'><span class='err'>risk</span></a>...</span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 01, p10].</em>
  Risk...risks...risks: should all three instances of 'risk' be either singular or plural? Colloquial speech.
<P>
  <span class='text'>It is <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n41/mode/2ups'><span class='err'>a kind of</span></a> pretty place.</span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 02, p26].</em>
  Change to 'kind of a pretty place'. Match the MS.
<P>

   Capitalize to Pond. This place name occurs elsewhere in a number of places in the text. 
   Might change 'Shore Road' in the same way.

  <em>[Ch. 03, p35].</em>
  Change the exclamation mark to a question mark.
  Why is she yelling? <em>The Annotated Anne of Green Gables</em> makes this change, but they don't note 
  it as a change. 
<P>
  <span class='text'>said Marilla sharply, <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n53/mode/2up'><span class='err'>eying</span></a> her</span><br>

  Change to 'eyeing'. The UK spelling 'eying' just looks odd.

  Change to 'four dark, low, turned posts'. Match the MS.

  <em>[Ch. 04, p43].</em>
   Seems completely backward from the intended sense.
   Why express enthusiasm for the undesired alternative?
   Move the exclamation point to the next sentence? Italicize 'was'?
   The author uses an exclamation point here not for expressing a positive feeling, but for expressing a <em>strong</em> feeling.
   Chapter 31 has a similar sentence: 'Suppose they did not pass!'.

  Strange wording, similar to 'down-stairs', but with two words.

  Ambiguous, poorly worded; what 'that' means is clear only after re-reading the sentence.
  Saw that 'she was' aggravating?
<P>

  The woman is named in 3 ways, in this order: 'Mrs. Peter Blewett', 'Mrs. Peter', and 'Mrs. Blewett'.
  Could her first name really have been Peter? Or is that her husband's first name? 
  It seems entirely intentional on Montgomery's part. 
  'Mrs. Peter' reminds me of 'Mrs. Rachel' for Mrs. Rachel Lynde.
  Chapter 16 has 'Mr. and Mrs. Chester Ross', 'Mrs. Chester Ross'.

  Change 'work' to 'go' (as in go bad). Match the MS, and 1925-GGH.
  I've never heard an Islander use 'work' in this way. 
  In the Cdn Oxford Dict., one definition of 'to work' is 'to ferment'.
  Is this usage of 'go' in the <a href='https://utorontopress.com/ca/dictionary-of-prince-edward-island-english-2'>Pratt/Burke Dictionary</a>?

  Change 'family' to 'wife', as in MS. 
  It was stated previously in the text that the couple is childless.
  <em>Annotated</em> does this, and I agree.
<P>
  <span class='text'>but <span class='err'><a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n267/mode/2up'>steadily ate</a></span></a> away at it.</span><br>

  Capitalize to 'Queen’s'? 
  The time frame of the novel is never precisely stated, as far as I know.
  Does this sentence imply that the action is taking place in the Victorian era?
  Queen Victoria died in 1901, and was succeeded by a male monarch.

  Add a comma after 'teach'. Without a comma, 'there' erroneously refers to Avonlea, on first reading.

<P>General speed bump issue: there are many times when the speech of the characters seems slightly too formal for rural Islanders. 
For example, contractions such as <em>it is</em> versus <em>it's</em>. 

<P>In chapter 5:
<ul>
 <li>if I hadn't had an imagination 
 <li>if I hadn't an imagination (as in the manuscript)
</ul>

In chapter 15: 
<ul>
<li>Marilla, that is the first compliment I have ever had
<li>Marilla, that is the first compliment I ever had (as in Ryerson 1946, more colloquial)
</ul>

For Anne in particular, Montgomery is trying to walk a delicate tight-rope: when young, her diction is part rural, part polished.
It's hard to know where to draw the line.

<P>General speed bump issue: the persistent use of quotations to refer to items: titles, idiom, and so on.
I would prefer italics.

<P>General speed bump issue: the spelling isn't completely consistent.
Here are some examples, with the number of occurrences of each variant:
<ul>
 <li>Lovers’ Lane / Lover’s Lane (10/5)
 <li>pedlar / peddler (4/1)
 <li>for ever / forever (16/7)
 <li>far-away / far away (2/7)
</ul>

<h3 id='ways-to-distinguish-provenance'>Ways To Distinguish Provenance</h3>
It's fun to try and guess the provenance of a given text, to see where it might come from.
Modern non-critical editions of the book often don't state the source text explicitly.
You may want to play detective and guess at the possible origin of the text. 
This game is uncertain because editions can make use of:
<ul>
 <li>Americanization (<em>parlor</em>, not <em>parlour</em>)
 <li>modernization (<em>today</em>, not <em>to-day</em>)
 <li>spell-checkers
 <li>multiple sources for the text
 <li>arbitrary changes made by an editor
</ul>

<P>The following <b>applies to early editions only.</b>
See 2007-NCE and <em>Annotated</em> for more info.


<P>There is a sentence in chapter 16 which is distinct between three main early editions. 
It happens when Anne discovers that Diana got drunk on 'raspberry cordial':
<ul>
 <li>1908-LCP: <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n199/mode/2up'><em>face downward on the sofa in an agony</em></a>
 <li>1925-GGH: <a href='https://archive.org/details/anneofgreengable00mont_12/page/148/mode/2up'><em>face downward on the sofa <b>in agony</b></em></a>
 <li>1925-LCP : <a href='https://archive.org/details/anneofgreengable00montiala/page/162/mode/2up'><em>face downward<b>s</b> on the sofa in an agony</em></a> (same as 1942-RP)
 <li>1924-Cornstalk : <a href='https://archive.org/details/anne-of-green-gables_20201025/page/132/mode/2up'><em>face downward<b>s</b> on the sofa in an agony</em></a> (same as 1925-LCP)
</ul>



<P>1908-LCP and 1925-LCP can also be distinguished using these characteristics:
<ul>
 <li>chapter 1: <em>Barnado boy</em> in 1908, and <em>Home boy</em> in 1925
 <li>chapter 1: <em>Hopetown</em> in 1908, and <em>Hopeton</em> in 1925
 <li>chapter 17: 
  The presence of <em>comune</em> maps to editions prior to 1925 (I think).
 Anne's letter has three intentional spelling errors in it: <em>comune</em>, <em>busum</em>, and <em>improoving</em>, as in 1908.
 Both 1925-GGH and 1925-LCP (I think) revert the spelling of one of the three words to <em>commune</em>.
 (In modern editions, editors can unwittingly apply spell-checkers to these words.)
</ul>

<P>1925-LCP has these characteristic errors that identify it:
<ul>
 <li>chapter 14: <em>beatification</em> is changed to <em>beautification</em>
 <li>chapter 14: <em>all ready</em> is changed to <em>already</em>
 <li>chapter 19: <em>ecstasy</em> is misspelled as <em>ecstacy</em>
</ul>

I don't know if these 1925-LCP errors were ever corrected. 
They are still present in 1946-RY.
Ryerson used the 1925-LCP plates.


<P>1925-GGH has these characteristics that help identify it:
<ul>
 <li>chapter 5: the spelling of the author's name <em>Thompson</em> is corrected to <em>Thomson</em>
 <li>chapter 2: <em>wondering afar, star-led</em> is changed to <em>wandering afar, star-led</em> (matches MS)
 <li>chapter 2: <em>yellowish grey wincey</em> is changed to <em>yellowish white wincey</em>
 <li>chapter 16: <em>beginning to work</em> is changed to <em>beginning to go</em> (matches MS)
</ul>


<h4 id='provenance-of-pg-transcription'>The Provenance of Project Gutenberg's 2016 Transcription</h4>
The Project Gutenberg 2016 transcription doesn't state its copy-text. 
Using the above, it seems like it may be a mongrel text, 
derived from more than one source (modernized, Americanized, and extensively edited), based on the following 
contradictory observations:
<ul>
 <li>chapter 16: <em>face downward on the sofa in an agony</em> (so: LCP)
 <li>chapter 1: <em>Home boy</em> (so: 1925-LCP)
 <li>chapter 1: <em>Hopeton</em> (so: 1925-LCP)
 <li>chapter 17: <em>commune</em> (so: 1925-LCP)
 <li>chapter 5: <em>Thompson</em> (so: not 1925-GGH)
 <li>chapter 2: <em>yellowish grey</em> (so: not 1925-GGH)
 <li>chapter 19: <em>ecstasy</em> (so: not 1925-LCP)
 <li>chapter 14: <em>beatification</em> (so: not 1925-LCP)
</ul>

<h3 id='issues-in-specific-editions-transcriptions'>Issues In Specific Editions/Transcriptions</h3>
I found most, but not all, of these issues from doing a <em>diff</em> between two branches in git.
(I have <em>not</em> proof-read these other sources. I have only proof-read the 1908-LCP-4th text.)
<b>As you can see, many transcription errors are detected by doing a simple <em>diff</em>.</b>

<P>
I haven't included the (2016) Project Gutenberg transcription here, because the number of issues for them is too large!

<h3 id='propagating-errors'>Example of Long Term Error Propagation</h3>
Errors can persist for a long time. They can also reappear.
As an example, take the error in the last chapter (listed above):

<P>
  <span class='text'>told her Thomas that <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n453/mode/2up'><span class='err'>night.</span></a></span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 38, p426]</em>
  Period should be a comma or a colon, 'night,' or 'night:'. 
  MS has a comma. 
  In chapter 15, some paragraphs end in a comma (unusual), just before a character begins speaking.

 <li>1: Changed <em>Barnado boy</em>  to <em>“Home” boy</em> (with quotes). That points to 1927-GGH, according to 2007-NCE.
 <li>2: the <em>A Note on the Text</em> states that a correction is applied, but in the body of the text it is not.
 <li>3: changes the tense: <em>it was as much as he did</em>
 <li>4: changed to: <em>Let you and me</em>

<h3 id='utf8-encoding-everywhere'>UTF-8 Encoding Everywhere</h3>

<h3 id='standardized-line-breaks'>Standardized Line Breaks</h3>

The <em>git</em> tool compares files line by line, and character by character.
It has no knowledge of what a sentence is. 

<P>It can easily compare text that has the same line breaks, say

<P style="white-space: pre;"><em>
At first Matthew suggested getting a Barnardo boy. 
But I said ‘no’ flat to that.</em></P>

<P>versus the slightly different text:
<p style="white-space: pre;"><em>
At first Matthew suggested getting a Barnado boy. 
But I said ‘no’ flat to that.</em></p>

<P>But it <b>can't effectively compare text that has different line breaks</b>:
<P style="white-space: pre;"><em>
At first Matthew suggested getting a Barnardo boy. 
But I said ‘no’ flat to that.</em></p>

<P>versus:

<p style="white-space: pre;"><em>
At first Matthew suggested getting 
a Barnardo boy. But I said ‘no’ flat
to that.</em>
</p>

<P>With such text, <em>git</em> will find a huge number of trivial differences just because of the line breaks.

<P>With two independent sources of a text, it's extremely likely that the line-breaks will differ.
The work-around is to enforce a simple policy: <b>each line is a complete sentence</b>. 
 
<h3 id='standardized-format'>Standardized Format</h3>
The transcriptions in this project have the following format:
<ul>
 <li>one sentence per line (as described above)
 <li>a new paragraph is represented by a single empty line
 <li>italics are represented by underscores: _like this_ stands for <em>like this</em>
 <li>there's no representation of <b>bold</b> text
 <li>quotations use left-quote and right-quote “”, not vertical quote ": <em>“Hello there,” said...</em>
 <li>apostrophes use ’, not ': <em>I’ll</em>
 <li>indentation is never used
 <li>chapter titles at the start of a file are in all-caps
 <li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash'>em dash</a> is used (not hyphen)
 <li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_caps'>small caps</a> are not represented
 <li>the files are encoded in UTF-8, so that any glyph can be represented
</ul>


<h3 id='toolkit'>Toolkit</h3>
In this project I used these tools:
<ul>
 <li>the <a href='https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/'>Eclipse</a> editor
 <li><a href='https://git-scm.com/'>git-bash</a> for running git commands
 <li>two repositories on github.com (one for transcriptions, one for documentation)
 <li><a href='https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Unicode/whatisit.html'>this tool</a> was occasionally used to show the Unicode designation of unusual characters
</ul>

<P>Here's a <a href='images/eclipse.jpg'>screen shot</a> of <a href='https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/'>Eclipse</a> being used to proof-read text versus a scanned 
version of the book on archive.org. 
Note how it is wrapping the long sentences in the window, and showing special symbols for spaces and line breaks.
It helps to have a wide screen; larger text reduces eye strain.

<P>Here's a <a href='images/diff.png'>screen shot</a> of Eclipse showing the <em>diff</em> for Chapter 10 of the novel.
The <em>diff</em> shows the differences between <em>this</em> project's text (left) and that of Distributed Proofreaders Canada (right). 
It shows the same file, but from two different <em>branches</em> in <em>git</em>.
You can see that the word <em>look</em> is mistakenly transcribed by DPC as <em>took</em>.
If you look at the <a href='https://archive.org/details/anneofgreengable00montiala/page/98/mode/1up?q=%22I+took+at%22'>image of the page</a>, it seems likely that this error occurred during the original OCR scan of the book. 
Indeed, you can see that archive.org's scanner is making the exact same error, mistaking <em>look</em> for <em>took</em>.
This is a good demonstration of how effective it is to compare one transcription to another: it lets us find each others errors (but not all of them).

<h4 id='text-editor-recommendations'>Text Editor Recommendations</h3>
For this project, here's a list of recommendations for your text editor: 
<ul>
 <li>it should have menu actions for saving changes to the <em>git</em> repository (it should know about <em>git</em>)
 <li>it must use UTF-8 encoding (check the settings)
 <li>it must not have an auto-correction tool
 <li>it can apply line-wrap without hyphenating text on the right margin
 <li>it can apply line-wrap to text without saving temporary line breaks to the underlying file
 <li>it should be able to indicate invisible characters (spaces and line breaks)
 <li>it should be able to show the <em>diff</em> between versions of a file
 <li>it would be nice if it could show the Unicode designation of a character, for example <em>U+0074 : LATIN SMALL LETTER T</em>; if not, you can use <a href='https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Unicode/whatisit.html'>this tool</a>
</ul>
