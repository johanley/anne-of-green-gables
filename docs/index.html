<h2>The <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> + <em>Git</em> Project</h2>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<ul> 
 <li>to <b>significantly improve</b> the quality of digitized versions of the novel
 <li>to <b>detect errors</b> by doing <em>diffs</em> between different transcriptions
 <li>to explore the variations between editions
 <li>to <a href='https://www.lulu.com/'>print</a> a copy of the novel, using a robust text
</ul>

<P>You can also use the text to create your own e-book, in epub or mobi format.

<h3>Why use <em><a href='https://git-scm.com/'>git</a></em>?</h3>
<ul> 
 <li>it can reflect different transcriptions/editions naturally using different <em>branches</em>
 <li>it lets you clearly see the variants (the <em>diff</em>) between editions
 <li>it lets you post improvements after each proof-reading cycle
 <li>it's a widely used, robust tool, well-suited to the job
</ul>

<h3>Two <em>github</em> Repositories</h3>
This project has two github repositories, not one:
<ul>
 <li><em><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables'>anne-of-green-gables</a></em>: a repo for documentation (which you're reading now), with one branch only.
 <li><em><a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables-editions'>anne-of-green-gables-editions</a></em>: a repo for various transcriptions of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>, with one branch for each transcription.
 Merging between branches is not a typical operation in this project. The main requirement is simply to do <em>diffs</em> between branches.
</ul>

<h3>Lingo</h3>

<ul>
 <li><b>copy text</b> - the exact book which is being transcribed (identified by publisher, year, impression, and so on).
 <li><b>transcription</b> - the content of the <em>copy text</em>, in a text file. The text file is usually proof-read by one or more humans.
 <li><b>transcription error</b> - a mismatch between the <em>copy text</em> and its <em>transcription</em>. 
 <li><b>branch</b> - in a version control system (such as <em><a href='https://git-scm.com/'>git</a></em>), a <em>branch</em> is a separate, parallel stream, containing a 
 sequence of revisions of files.
 In this project, different <em>copy texts</em> get different <em>branches</em> for their <em>transcriptions</em>.
 Each <em>branch</em> can have multiple revisions of its <em>transcription</em>.
 <li><b>diff</b> - the result of comparing two revisions of a file (often across different <em>branches</em>). Shows the textual 
 variations, the places where the two revisions differ in any way. Here's an <a href='images/diff.png'>example</a> of 
 a tool showing a diff.
</ul>

<h3>Simple Scheme for Error Detection</h3>

<P>From what I can see, the groups on the web that provide transcriptions don't talk to each other. 
They don't compare their transcriptions to the output of other similar groups. 

<P>The idea of this project is simply that <span class='err'><b>doing diffs on independent transcriptions is an easy way to 
find a large number of errors, and significantly increase accuracy.</b></span>

<P>Some lingo:
<ul>
 <li><b>TE(A)</b> - the transcription errors in a single transcription A. 
 <li><b>UTE(A, B, C)</b> - the <em>universal</em> transcription errors <em>common</em> to a <em>set</em> of transcriptions A, B, C.   
 That is, the transcription errors <b>repeated in exactly the same way</b> across all members of a set of transcriptions A, B, and C.
</ul>

<h4>Work Flow For Improving My Transcription</h4>

<img src='images/work-flow-diagram.png' title='Work flow'>
<P>First I do a full proof-read of my transcription.

<P>Then, for each of the other transcriptions A, B, C:
<ul>
 <li>I do a diff between <em>me</em> and the other transcription
 <li>for each difference, I find out if it's a real textual difference in the copy text, or a transcription error. 
 I do this by visually comparing directly with the copy text itself (for example on archive.org).
 <li>if it's a transcription error, then I fix one of the transcriptions (in rare cases, both). 
 In this case, I'm removing one item from TE(me) or TE(A).
 Note that only the <em>non-universal</em> transcription errors are found using this technique.
</ul> 

At the end of the process, what's left over is UTE(A, B, C, me), the universal transcription errors, the ones that are <b>exactly the same in <em>all</em> of the transcriptions</b>.

<P>The UTE(A, B, C, me) errors are more difficult to deal with.
They can't be found by doing diffs, since they are present in all of the input transcriptions.
Can they be detected using other means?
In a few isolated cases, yes. 
If a policy of Americanization or modernization has been applied to all transcriptions, then that policy can be 
reversed, in whole or in part, by writing a simple find-replace script to change the transcription.
But those are special cases (marked as 'known', in the above diagram).


<h4>Rule 1: All non-universal errors can be eliminated by doing diffs.</h4>

<b>TE(me) = UTE(A, B, C, me)</b>

<P>At the end of the process described above, the transcription errors in my output equal the <em>universal</em> transcription errors
across all of the inputs. This expresses the benefit of doing diffs. 

<h4>Rule 2: Independent transcriptions having no common ancestor are best.</h4>
It's best that each transcription be as <em>independent</em> from the others as possible:
<ul>
 <li>different copy text
 <li>different OCR (optical character recognition) machine/software
 <li>different proof-readers 
 <li>different organizations
</ul> 

Such independence pushes the system in the direction of avoiding universal transcription errors.

<P>Somewhat surprisingly, it's beneficial to even use different editions of the source text.
For example, this project uses a transcription of a 1946 edition of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> to 
produce a transcription of the 1908 edition (4th impression).
This is beneficial because it <em>ensures more independence</em> of transcriptions. 
It's not a problem, because the real textual diffs between 1908 and 1946 are small, and are detected and accounted for by the 
work flow described above.

<h4>Rule 3: In the end, for a large text, you'll never be sure that you have reduced TE(me) to zero.</h4>
A computer can compute an exact result only when all of the data is present. 
But in this case, one half of the data is in a physical book, outside the computer. That's the problem.
Still, you can increase your level of confidence in a transcription by using the above technique.

<P>Interesting remarks from the critical edition of Rubio and Waterston:
<ul>
 <li>regarding Page's 40th impression, published in 1916: <em>"no other copy-text can claim to represent her final intentions as much as this 1908 edition."</em>
 <li><em>"Montgomery gave no personal input into either of these completely new 1925 editions."</em>
 <li>regarding the two new 1925 editions: <em>"However, a careful comparison of the newly set Harrap and L. C. Page texts (which are very different in themselves)
 reveals a common line of descent—not from the manuscript but from the lost typescript."</em>
</ul>

<h3>Scanned Books</h3>
Some editions have been imaged and made available on the web, mostly by archive.org.

<P>
There are <a href='https://confederationcentre.com/news/major-digital-exhibition-of-anne-manuscript-announced/'>plans</a> to make images of the manuscript available in 2022.
Montgomery's handwriting is hard to read. Most would prefer the <a href='https://nimbus.ca/store/anne-of-green-gables-the-original-manuscript.html'>transcription</a> edited by C. S. Collins.

<h3>Other Sources of Digitized Versions</h3>

<ul>
 <li><a href='https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20080509'>Faded Page</a> - current version as of 2008-05-09. Companion site to <a href='https://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/default.php'>Distributed Proofreaders Canada</a>. 
 Their copy-text is the 1946-11 Ryerson edition (see link above). <b>Seems to be of good quality, but see corrections listed below.</b>
 <li><a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45'>Project Gutenberg</a> - current version as of 2016-10-06. They usually get texts from Distributed Proofreaders, but not always. They don't even indicate the copy-text. <b>The quality of this text seems low.</b> 
 The copy-text seems to be some arbitrary edition having substantial differences with 1908.
 <li><a href='https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/l-m-montgomery/anne-of-green-gables'>Standard Ebooks</a> - apparently uses Project Gutenberg as source of their text. (I don't know if they have proof-read/edited the text themselves. I suspect not.)
 <li><a href='https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Anne_of_Green_Gables_(1908)'>Wikisource</a>
</ul>

Issues:
<ul>
 <li>sometimes they aren't explicit about the copy-text used as source.
 <li>basic facts are sometimes unclear, or hard to find: how many versions of this digitized text have there been? 
 what were the changes between versions? 
 how many people have proof-read the text, over its lifetime?
 <li>in short, there's no way to evaluate the probable quality of the transcription.
</ul>


<h3>Policy For Typos</h3>
Almost every transcription has items that could be corrected in some way (typos and so on). 
<b>In this project, absolutely all corrections to the core text are handled by using multiple <em>branches</em> in <em>git</em></b>:
<ul>
 <li><b>the core branch for an edition will have zero corrections for typos</b> applied to it.
 <li>secondary branches, branched off of the core, are used to apply all corrections to the core text, including basic corrections for egregious typos.
</ul>

Some corrections are for egregious and obvious typos, but other corrections are more subtle.
(An example of a subtle correction is to change the spelling of <em>Macpherson</em> to <em>MacPherson</em>.)
<b>The policy of what to apply as a correction, and what not to apply, is a decision that can be made in many different ways.</b>
That policy is best relegated to a secondary branch, and not to the core data.
The core data remains the core data, without ambiguity, exactly matching the copy-text (we hope), while different policies for applying corrections can be applied at will in a secondary branch off of the core.

<h3>No Front Matter</h3>
This project captures the contents of the 38 chapters of the book.
Items outside the chapters, including the table of contents and dedication, aren't captured here.

<h3>Chapter Title Conventions</h3>
The chapter titles are to be placed on the first line of each chapter. 
The chapter title appears in the file names, but that is for convenience only.
The <em>official</em> chapter title is the first line of the text file.
For example, if you wish to put a comma in the title of <em>Diana is Invited to Tea with Tragic Results</em>, then just alter the first line of the 
file for that chapter. <b>Don't change the name of the file</b>. That would mess things up.

 
<h3>Current Proof-reading/Editing Status</h3>
This project is currently transcribing the L. C. Page 1908 4th impression.
In addition to proof-reading the text, the project is finding diffs with respect to other transcriptions, using the technique described above.

<P>The other transcriptions come from:
<ul>
 <li>Distributed Proofreaders of Canada
 <li>Wikisource
 <li>Project Gutenberg
</ul>

<P>The above table will be useful in evaluating the probable quality of a text. The table:
<ul>
 <li>shows how many proof-reads/edits have been completed, and by how many different people
 <li>shows the count of the changes made with respect to the previous version
 <li>links to the actual changes made to the previous version, so you can see who made each change, and its exact nature
</ul>
<b>The first proof-read/edit has less information</b>, since there's no previous version to compare it to.

<P>However, for the first proof-read only, I compare the result to 3 other digitized versions 
(<em>Project Gutenberg</em>, <em>Distributed Proofreaders Canada</em>, and <em>Wikisource</em>).
Then, I display here the number of errors in 'my' text found as a result of such comparisons.
This has been <em>very</em> useful for finding errors!
The lower the count, the better the proof-reader.

<h2>Known Issues: 1908, 4th impression</h2>
There are different types of issues encountered in this text.
A small number are serious, some are <em>medjum</em>, but most are <em>weeny-teeny</em>.
They are collected here to aid those who wish to edit the text, and produce their own version.
See also the <em>Norton</em> critical edition and <em>The Annotated Anne of Green Gables</em> for more detailed information.


<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<b>I'm adding to these lists as I go along, after proof-reading each chapter.</b>

  <em>[Ch. 03, p37].</em>
  'Anne sighed' should have a new paragraph. The image of the page is cut off on the left, but there's just enough to see that there's no new paragraph. 
  The paragraph is present in the <a href='https://archive.org/details/anneofgreengable00mont_11/page/36/mode/2up'>the 11th</a> impression (and possibly earlier).
  It's also in the MS.

  <em>[Ch. 37, p416]</em>
  Change to 'a while'.
  The noun phrase 'a while' has two words. The adverb form 'awhile' is a single word.
  Chapter 16 uses 'awhile' correctly. 

<P>* I haven't seen this issue mentioned elsewhere. I may have found it first, but I'm not sure.

<h3>John's Speed Bumps</h3>
In the list below, I list some issues that I personally would like to examine when creating my own version of the text.
<b>They are a matter of opinion.
Don't take them too seriously.</b>
I'm just noting them here for my own benefit. 
You can take them as an example of the kind of edits someone might make to the core text, according to their taste.
These <em>speed bumps</em> are places in the text where, while reading, my attention is distracted from the make-believe world of the story to 
the real world of thinking about the text's style.

<P>
  <span class='text'>And as for the <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n25/mode/2up'><span class='err'>risk</span></a>...</span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 01, p10].</em>
  Risk...risks...risks: should all three instances of 'risk' be either singular or plural? Colloquial speech.
<P>
  <span class='text'>It is <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n41/mode/2ups'><span class='err'>a kind of</span></a> pretty place.</span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 02, p26].</em>
  Change to 'kind of a pretty place'. Match the MS.

  <em>[Ch. 02, p28].</em>
   Capitalize to Pond. This place name occurs elsewhere in a number of places in the text. 
   Might change 'Shore Road' in the same way.
<P>
  <span class='text'><em>Call</em> you <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n51/mode/2up'><span class='err'>Cordelia!</span></a></span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 03, p35].</em>
  Change the exclamation mark to a question mark.
  Why is she yelling? <em>The Annotated Anne of Green Gables</em> makes this change, but they don't note 
  it as a change. 
<P>
  <span class='text'>said Marilla sharply, <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n53/mode/2up'><span class='err'>eying</span></a> her</span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 03, p37].</em>
  Change to 'eyeing'. The UK spelling 'eying' just looks odd.
<P>
  <span class='text'>four dark, <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n55/mode/2up'><span class='err'>low-turned</span></a> posts</span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 03, p39].</em>
  Change to 'four dark, low, turned posts'. Match the MS.
<P>
  <span class='text'>Suppose she wasn’t really going to stay <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n59/mode/2up'><span class='err'>here!</span></a></span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 04, p43].</em>
   Seems completely backward from the intended sense.
   Why express enthusiasm for the undesired alternative?
   Move the exclamation point to the next sentence? Italicize 'was'?
<P>

  <em>[Ch. 04, p47].</em>
   The commas are superfluous, since the em dashes already do the work.

  <em>[Ch. 04, p50].</em>
  Change to 'down to the cellar'?
  Strange wording, similar to 'down-stairs', but with two words.
<P>
  <span class='text'>saw <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n69/mode/2up'><span class='err'>that</span></a> aggravating Matthew</span><br>

  Ambiguous, poorly worded; what 'that' means is clear only after re-reading the sentence.
  Saw that 'she was' aggravating?
<P>
  <span class='text'><a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n79/mode/2up'><span class='err'>Mrs. Peter</span></a> has a large family</span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 06, p63].</em>
  The woman is named in 3 ways, in this order: 'Mrs. Peter Blewett', 'Mrs. Peter', and 'Mrs. Blewett'.
  Could her first name really have been Peter? Or is that her husband's first name? 
  It seems entirely intentional on Montgomery's part. 
  'Mrs. Peter' reminds me of 'Mrs. Rachel' for Mrs. Rachel Lynde.
<P>
  <span class='text'>as plain as waist and skirt <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n127/mode/2up'><span class='err'>and tight</span></a> as sleeves</span><br>

   Add a comma somewhere? After 'skirt'?

   Add a comma after 'daunted'? See <a href='https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/nothing-daunted'>reference</a>.
<P>
  <span class='text'>nor <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n135/mode/2up'><span class='err'>‘Midian,’</span></a> either, but it sounds</span><br>

  Remove the comma after Midian? Not in MS.

   Remove the comma?
<P>
  <span class='text'>in from the <a href=''><span class='err'>yard,</span></a> eyes shining,</span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 13, p126].</em>
   Printing defect. The comma is barely visible; make sure it's there.
<P>

  <em>[Ch. 13, p129].</em>
 Should the statement be a question?
<P>
  <span class='text'>There’s another, <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n237/mode/2u'><span class='err'><em>not</em></span></a> a sister,</span><br>
  <em>[Ch. 19, p215].</em>
  The <a href='https://archive.org/details/hhfbc196-bingenontherhine'>original text</a> has no italics for 'not'.

<P>General speed bump issue:<br>
There are many times when the speech of the characters seems slightly too formal for rural Islanders. 
For example, contractions such as <em>it is</em> versus <em>it's</em>, and (in chapter 5) <em>if I hadn't had an imagination</em> versus <em>if I hadn't an imagination</em> (as in the manuscript).
For Anne in particular, Montgomery is trying to walk a delicate tight-rope: when young, her diction is part rural, part polished.
It's hard to know where to draw the line.



<h3>Issues I've Seen In Specific Editions/Transcriptions</h3>
I stumbled upon these at various times.
I'm noting them here in order to let the publishers know later, in case they are unaware of the issue.
I found most of these issues from doing a <em>diff</em> between two branches in git.
(I'm not proof-reading these other sources.)
<b>As you can see, a significant number of transcription errors are detected by doing a simple <em>diff</em>.</b>

<P>
I haven't included Project Gutenberg here, because the number of issues for them is too large!

<h3>Standardized Line Breaks</h3>

The <em>git</em> tool compares files line by line, and character by character.
It has no knowledge of what a sentence is. 

<P>It can easily compare text that has the same line breaks, say

<P style="white-space: pre;"><em>
At first Matthew suggested getting a Barnardo boy. 
But I said ‘no’ flat to that.</em></P>

<P>versus the slightly different text:
<p style="white-space: pre;"><em>
At first Matthew suggested getting a Barnado boy. 
But I said ‘no’ flat to that.</em></p>

<P>But it <b>can't effectively compare text that has different line breaks</b>:
<P style="white-space: pre;"><em>
At first Matthew suggested getting a Barnardo boy. 
But I said ‘no’ flat to that.</em></p>

<P>versus:

<p style="white-space: pre;"><em>
At first Matthew suggested getting 
a Barnardo boy. But I said ‘no’ flat
to that.</em>
</p>

<P>With such text, <em>git</em> will find a huge number of trivial differences just because of the line breaks.

<P>With two independent sources of a text, it's extremely likely that the line-breaks will differ.
The work-around is to enforce a simple policy: <b>each line is a complete sentence</b>. 
 
<h3>Text Editor Recommendations</h3>
If you're making changes directly to the files, it's recommended that your text editor software:
<ul>
 <li>should have menu actions for saving changes to the <em>git</em> repository (it should know about <em>git</em>)
 <li>must use UTF-8 encoding (check the settings)
 <li>must not have an auto-correction tool
 <li>can apply line-wrap without hyphenating text on the right margin
 <li>can apply line-wrap to text without saving temporary line breaks to the underlying file
 <li>should be able to indicate invisible characters (spaces and line breaks)
 <li>should be able to show the <em>diff</em> between versions of a file
</ul>

<h3>Screen Shots</h3>

Here's a <a href='images/eclipse.jpg'>screen shot</a> of the <a href='https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/'>Eclipse</a> code editor being used to proof-read text versus a scanned 
version of the book on archive.org. 
Note how it is wrapping the long sentences in the window, and showing special symbols for spaces and line breaks.
It helps to have a wide screen; larger text reduces eye strain.

<P>
Here's a <a href='images/diff.png'>screen shot</a> of <em>Eclipse</em> showing the <em>diff</em> for Chapter 10 of the novel.
The <em>diff</em> shows the differences between <em>this</em> project's text (left) and that of Distributed Proofreaders Canada (right). 
It shows the same file, but from two different <em>branches</em> in <em>git</em>.
You can see that the word <em>look</em> is mistakenly transcribed by DPC as <em>took</em>.
If you look at the <a href='https://archive.org/details/anneofgreengable00montiala/page/98/mode/2up'>image of the page</a>, it seems likely that this error occurred during the original OCR scan of the book. 
This is a good demonstration of how effective it is to compare one digitized version to another: it lets us find each others errors (but not all of them!).
